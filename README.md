# Weather_app.java

Hey!

Welcome!

Soon here will be described instructions for starting a RESTful web service that would handle GET requests to the path “weather” by returning the weather data determined by IP of the request originator. 

This service will perform a geolocation search using a non-commercial, 3rd party IP to the location provider.

After that service will use another non-commercial 3rd party service to determine current weather conditions using the coordinates of the IP.


In the meantime, you can view my other projects.
